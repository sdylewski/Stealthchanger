# Dock Tuner

**dock_tuner** is a helpful macro that provides an interactive interface for calibrating dock positions. It allows you to step through the docking/undocking sequence and adjust X, Y, and Z positions in real-time, then outputs the final values for your configuration files.

The macro was created by Contomo (SC.0164) for the StealthChanger community.

## Installation

1. Download the latest `dock_tuner.cfg` macro file:
   - Download from the [klipper-toolchanger-hard repository](https://github.com/Contomo/klipper-toolchanger-hard/blob/main/examples/dock%20location/fixed/dock_tuner.cfg)
   - Click the "Raw" button on GitHub to download the file directly
2. Copy the file to your Klipper config directory:
   - Copy `dock_tuner.cfg` to `~/printer_data/config/stealthchanger/dock_tuner.cfg`
   - The `stealthchanger` directory should already exist if you've installed klipper-toolchanger-easy
3. Add this line to your `printer.cfg`:
   ```ini
   [include stealthchanger/dock_tuner.cfg]
   ```
4. Run `FIRMWARE_RESTART` to load the macro

## Prerequisites

Before using dock_tuner, ensure you have:

- Set `params_close_y` and `params_safe_y` in `toolchanger-config.cfg` (see [Dock Calibration](DockCalibration.md#dock-parking-calibration-procedure))
- Roughly set your `params_park_x`, `params_park_y`, and `params_park_z` values in your tool config files (you can use the [manual calibration method](DockCalibration.md#dock-parking-calibration-procedure) to get initial values)

## Workflow for Calibrating All Tools

### 1. Prepare the Printer

- Home all axes with T0: `G28`
- Run quad gantry leveling: `QUAD_GANTRY_LEVEL`
- Re-home: `G28`

### 2. Calibrate T0

- Ensure T0 is on the shuttle and run `INITIALIZE_TOOLCHANGER`
- Run `dock_tuner` in the console
- The macro will provide an interactive interface to step through the docking sequence
- Follow the on-screen prompts to:
  - Step through each movement in the docking/undocking path
  - Adjust X, Y, and Z positions as needed (the macro will provide adjustment commands)
  - Test the docking and undocking sequence
- Continue adjusting until the tool docks and undocks smoothly and reliably
- When satisfied, the macro will output the final `params_park_x`, `params_park_y`, and `params_park_z` values in the console
- Copy these values to `stealthchanger/tools/T0.cfg` in the `[tool T0]` section:
  ```ini
  [tool T0]
  params_park_x: <value_from_dock_tuner>
  params_park_y: <value_from_dock_tuner>
  params_park_z: <value_from_dock_tuner>
  ```

### 3. Calibrate T1 (and Additional Tools)

**Important:** Avoid running `INITIALIZE_TOOLCHANGER` with T1 or other tools during calibration. While it's technically okay if your gcode_offsets are already perfectly calibrated, it applies offsets which can make the calibration process confusing. It's safer to work directly in T0's coordinate system. **DO NOT run `G28` with Tn** - This establishes Tn's coordinate system and will break calibration.

- Manually place T1 on the shuttle (or use T0 to pick it up from its dock)
- Run `dock_tuner` again
- The macro will detect the current tool and calibrate for that tool
- Follow the same adjustment process as T0
- When satisfied, copy the final values to `stealthchanger/tools/T1.cfg` in the `[tool T1]` section:
  ```ini
  [tool T1]
  params_park_x: <value_from_dock_tuner>
  params_park_y: <value_from_dock_tuner>
  params_park_z: <value_from_dock_tuner>
  ```

### 4. Repeat for All Remaining Tools

- For each additional tool (T2, T3, etc.), follow the same process as T1
- Remember: don't run `INITIALIZE_TOOLCHANGER` with non-T0 tools during calibration
- Copy the values to the corresponding tool config file (`stealthchanger/tools/Tn.cfg`)

### 5. Finalize

- Run `FIRMWARE_RESTART` to apply all changes
- Test tool changes between all tools to verify everything works correctly

## Tips

- dock_tuner allows you to see exactly where the tool tries to dock and identify alignment issues
- Watch for the [OctoTap](../Probes.md#tap) LED state change when the tool is detected during pickup
- Make small adjustments (0.1-0.5mm increments) and test frequently
- The Z position should be where 1mm more down would untrigger the tap module
- If you're having issues, check that you haven't accidentally run `INITIALIZE_TOOLCHANGER` with a non-T0 tool

## FAQ

### dock_tuner doesn't detect my tool
Make sure:
- The OctoTAP board is properly mounted and the optical sensor is aligned
- The tool is properly seated on the shuttle
- Your `params_pickup_path` includes a step with `verify:1` parameter
- The tool detection is working (you can test with `DETECT_ACTIVE_TOOL_PROBE`)

### Can I use dock_tuner with non-T0 tools?
Yes, but you must manually place the tool on the shuttle first. **DO NOT** run `G28` or `INITIALIZE_TOOLCHANGER` with non-T0 tools during calibration. Home with T0 first, then manually switch to the tool you want to calibrate.  

### dock_tuner moves too fast/slow
You can adjust the speed multiplier using the `SPD` parameter. For example, `DOCK_TUNER SPD=0.5` will run at 50% speed, or `DOCK_TUNER SPD=2.0` will run at 200% speed. Be careful with higher speeds to avoid collisions.

### The dock positions from dock_tuner don't match my manual calibration
This is normal - dock_tuner provides an interactive way to fine-tune positions. The values should be close to your manual calibration, but may need slight adjustments. Use dock_tuner to refine the positions for optimal tool changes.
