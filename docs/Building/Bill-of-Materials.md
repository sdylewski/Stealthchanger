[Kits are are now available](Vendors-and-Kits.md) for parts, but check which components are included!

All parts (screws, magnets, etc) are Voron, and Voron Tap standards.

## Shuttle
One [shuttle](../Shuttle.md) is required.  

## Backplates

x1 per toolhead

**The list bellow is in addition to the Stealthburner BOM above.**

## Backplate BOM for All Tools

- [4] m3 heat inserts
- [3] Ø4x12mm ssRod (dowel pin) with a rounded end **(if it has female threads on the back it will be listed as an M3, but make sure the pin is 4mm OD, that is what is important. We recommend the threaded pins for better fixing)**
- [1] 6x3mm magnet (N52 Highly recommended to counter the pull from the umbilicals. Note that most magnets not from a reputable source may say N52 but aren't actually. Recommend one of the two links below.)
- [2] m3x6 or m3x8 FHCS (Flat head countersunk screw, MUST BE MAGNETIC. no stainless, as per TAP)
- [1] [OptoTap](https://s.click.aliexpress.com/e/_DEGsGTV) (only the sensor PCB is required)
- [1] m3x8 BHCS (optional in v1.1)

## Toolheads
Individual toolhead BOMs are listed on each [toolhead page](../Toolheads/Toolheads.md). These are just a few examples.

### Tools
* Good ratcheting crimpers for JST-XH and other types of connectors
* Fine soldering iron for LEDs

### General toolhead BOM
* part cooling blowers, often 4010 blower
* Toolhead hotend fan, often 2510 axial
* Toolhead boards
* Backplate for each toolhead
* high-temp epoxy
* LEDs, often WS2812B individual LEDs
* Tons of M3x4x5 heatset inserts
* M3 SHCS and BHCS assorted screws

### Anthead
* TBD

### Dragonburner/Rapidburner/Yavoth

- [1] m3x12 BHCS (optional to keep spacer in place)
- [2] m3x35 SHCS
- [2] m3 heat inserts
- [2] m3x8 BHCS (optional in v1.1)


### Archetype Blackbird

- [1] m3x12 BHCS (to hold the sherpa mount in place)
- [2] m3 heat inserts
- [2] m3x8 BHCS (optional in v1.1)

### Xol

- [2] m3x6 BHCS (backplate lower mounting screws. m3x8 will be too long)
- [2] m3x20 BHCS (backplate upper mounting screws)
- [2] m3x8 BHCS (extruder mount to backplate)
- [2] m3x6 FHCS **magnetic** (preload screws. m3x8 will be too long)
- You will **not be able** to use stock 2.4 Z joints with Xol or A4T.
- Replacement of your Z joints with something with a lower profile such as [hartk123's GE5C Z Joint](https://github.com/VoronDesign/VoronUsers/tree/main/printer_mods/hartk1213/Voron2.4_GE5C) or [Ellis'Short Z Joints](https://github.com/VoronDesign/VoronUsers/tree/main/printer_mods/Ellis/Short_Z_Joints) is necessary to avoid bottoming out your Z carriage on the deck panel when using Xol or A4T.

### A4T

- [2] m3x45 SHCS **magnetic** (backplate lower mounting screws)
- [2] m3x12 BHCS / SHCS (backplate upper mounting screws)
- [2] m3x6 FHCS **magnetic** (preload screws. m3x8 will be too long)
- You will **not be able** to use stock 2.4 Z joints with Xol or A4T. See links in Xol section above for links to alternative suggestions.


## Electronics
see [CableManagement](../CableManagement/CableManagement.md)

## Tophat
You can print your own, build a kit, or source your own parts.  See the [TopHat page](../TopHat.md) for more info.

## X or Y Endstops

See [Endstops page](../Endstops.md).  Depends on your preferences


## Options

You will likely need help with belts, make sure to decide on if you will use the [shuttle keeper](https://github.com/DraftShift/Stealthchanger/tree/main/STLs/Extras) or use the [belt helper](https://github.com/DraftShift/Stealthchanger/tree/main/STLs/Extras/BeltHelper).  And print the required parts and make sure to have the addition bill of materials for them.


## Sexball probe

Calibration probe option that just replaces the shaft on a sexbolt.
- [Probe](https://s.click.aliexpress.com/e/_oB1egOH)
- [12mm Ball with M5 Threads](https://s.click.aliexpress.com/e/_o2DGfvf)
- [M5x30mm External Thread Pin](https://s.click.aliexpress.com/e/_omw2qxX)

**NOTE:** For micron M5x25mm Pin is tall enough

**NOTE:** Only use the hartk style bodys with the sleeves, knockoffs have too much slop.

Due to QC issues, this is an [Alternative bushing](https://s.click.aliexpress.com/e/_DFJQgtN) which has also been tested and works fine.
